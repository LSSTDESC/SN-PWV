Data Provenance
===============

This project takes advantage of multiple pre-existing research efforts, some
which are external to the DESC. Listed below is a summary of data sets used
by this project and their origins.

Atmospheric Measurments
-----------------------

**Repository Path:** *Not included with project source code*

**Data Source:** https://www.suominet.ucar.edu/

**Description:**
    Meteorological measurements taken and various global positions are used to
    characterize atmospheric variability over time. This data is taken by
    the SuomiNet project and it's affiliated teams / projects. Data access is
    provided using the `pwv_kpno` `API <https://mwvgroup.github.io/pwv_kpno/>`_.

CTIO Filters
------------

**Repository Path:** *data/filters/ctio/**

**Data Source:**

**Description:**
    Filter response curves corresponding to the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) used
    by the Cerro Telolo International Observatory (CTIO).


LSST Filters
------------

**Repository Path:** *data/filters/lsst/**

**Data Source:** cloned from https://github.com/lsst/throughputs .

**Description:**
    Filter response curves curves considered as the 'baseline' performance of LSST.
