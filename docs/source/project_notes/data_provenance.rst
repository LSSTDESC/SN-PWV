Data Provenance
===============

This project takes advantage of results from multiple pre-existing research
efforts, some which are external to the DESC. Listed below is a summary of
data sets used by this project and their origins.

Atmospheric Measurements
------------------------

**Repository Path:** Data access provided by the ``pwv_kpno`` `API <https://mwvgroup.github.io/pwv_kpno/>`_.

**Data Source:** `The SuomiNet Project <https://www.suominet.ucar.edu/>`_

**Description:**
    Meteorological measurements taken at various global positions are used to
    characterize atmospheric variability over time. This data is taken by
