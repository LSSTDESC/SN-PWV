This directory contains a small subset of data published as part of
the PLaSTICC light-curve simulations. It contains only enough data to 
demonstrate the package and run the test_suite. 

The `.fits` files in this directory are  generated using the 
``scripts/plasticc/make_test_data.py`` script and are written using
the file structure expected by the ``snat_sim.plasticc`` module.

To download the complete PLaSTICC data, download the data listed in
``file_list.txt`` (See the project documentation for further 
instructions).
