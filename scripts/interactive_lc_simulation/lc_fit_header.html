<h1>Simulating Light-Curves with PWV</h1>
<h2>Usage Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Use the sliders in the left hand panel to choose the input values for a light-curve simulation.
        By default, light-curves are calibrated against a reference star catalog comprising a G2, M5, and K2 type star.
        Click the "Plot Light-Curve" button to update the plots and visualize the simulated light-curve
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the widgets in the right hand panel to prepare your fitted model.
        The sliders represent the initial guess used when fitting.
        Each of these values (except PWV) are automatically updated in the previous step to reflect the simulated model.
        Click the "Plot Current Model" button to visualize your model using the currently chosen parameters.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the "Fit and Plot Model" button.
        The plots, fitted model sliders, and results panel will update to show the fit results.
        A text notice is displayed for failed or errored fits.
    </li>
</ol>
